# Creating Rules — Meta-Guidelines

When adding or editing rules under `.cursor/rules/`, follow these practices so rules stay useful and maintainable.

## Do

- **Keep each rule under 500 lines.** If it grows, split into multiple, composable rules (e.g. `api-conventions.mdc`, `api-errors.mdc`).
- **Be focused and scoped.** One main concern per rule; avoid "and also everything about X."
- **Be actionable.** Write like clear internal docs: what to do, when, and why. Prefer concrete "do this / don't do that" over vague advice.
- **Use examples or references.** Prefer short snippets or "see `path/to/file`" over long pastes. Reference files instead of copying their contents so rules don't go stale as code changes.
- **Reuse rules.** When the same guidance would be repeated in chat, add or point to a rule instead of re-explaining.

## Don't

- **Don't copy full style guides.** Rely on the linter and formatter for style; rules should cover project-specific choices, not generic conventions.
- **Don't document every command.** The agent already knows common tools (npm, git, pytest, etc.). Only document project-specific scripts, env setup, or non-obvious workflows.
- **Don't add rare edge cases.** Keep rules focused on patterns you use often; skip one-off or rarely applicable instructions.
- **Don't duplicate the codebase.** Point to canonical examples (file + area) instead of copying code into the rule.

## Rule file format

- Use `.mdc` in `.cursor/rules/` with YAML frontmatter: `description`, optional `globs`, and `alwaysApply` (true for global rules, false for file-scoped).
- For file-specific rules, set `globs` (e.g. `**/*.ts`, `docs/**/*.md`) so the rule applies when those files are relevant.

## Quick check

Before saving a new or edited rule: Is it under 500 lines? Focused? Actionable? Referencing files instead of pasting large blocks? If not, trim or split.
