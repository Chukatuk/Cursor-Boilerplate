description: Defines when and how the AI proposes new rules or anti-patterns based on observed code patterns and repeated human corrections.

# Self-Improvement Protocol

The AI watches for recurring patterns not yet captured in the rule system and proposes new rules when they emerge. The human always approves before any rule is written.

## Triggers for proposing a new rule

**Repeated human correction**
If the human corrects the same type of mistake **3 or more times**, the AI must:
1. Recognize the pattern.
2. Propose a new rule or an anti-pattern addition to an existing rule.
3. State explicitly: "I've noticed I keep making this mistake. Should I add a rule to prevent it?"

**Frequently used undocumented pattern**
If the AI writes the same structural pattern **3+ times** (e.g., a specific error wrapper, a naming convention, a file structure) and no rule documents it yet:
1. Propose a rule that formalizes the pattern.
2. Reference the specific files where the pattern appears.

## How to propose a rule

Present the draft in chat:

```
RULE PROPOSAL: <proposed filename>
Trigger: <what pattern triggered this>
Draft content:
---
[full .mdc file content]
---
Approve to write this rule?
```

## Hard constraints

- Never write a rule file without explicit human approval.
- Never modify an existing rule without showing the diff and getting approval.
- Do not propose rules for one-off edge cases — only for patterns that repeat 3+ times.
- Do not duplicate what is already covered in existing rules. Check `.cursor/rules/` first.
