# Python Conventions (EXAMPLE)

> **This is an example rule shipped with the boilerplate.** Delete it or replace it with your project's actual conventions. It exists to show what a good tech rule looks like.

## Project structure

```
src/
├── api/           # Route handlers
├── services/      # Business logic
├── models/        # Pydantic models and DB schemas
├── core/          # Config, dependencies, middleware
└── utils/         # Shared helpers
```

## Error handling

This project has service functions return result dicts rather than raising exceptions to route handlers. This is one valid approach — if your team prefers exceptions with middleware-level handling, remove this section and document your own pattern.

```python
# This project's approach: service returns a result dict, route handler checks it
def get_user(user_id: str) -> dict:
    user = db.get(user_id)
    if not user:
        return {"ok": False, "error": "USER_NOT_FOUND"}
    return {"ok": True, "data": user}
```

## Naming

| Thing | Convention | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Files | snake_case | `user_profile.py` |
| Functions | snake_case | `get_user_by_id()` |
| Classes | PascalCase | `UserProfile` |
| Constants | SCREAMING_SNAKE | `MAX_RETRY_COUNT` |

## Anti-patterns

- Never use `*` imports.
- Never use mutable default arguments (`def f(items=[])`).
- Never silence exceptions with bare `except:` — always catch specific types.
