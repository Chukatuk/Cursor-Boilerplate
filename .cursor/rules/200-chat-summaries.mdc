# Chat Summary Guidelines

Reference this when creating a chat summary at the end of a work session.

## When to create a summary

Create one when you:

- Implement a new feature (even small ones)
- Fix a bug, especially a non-obvious one
- Make an architectural decision
- Refactor existing code
- Resolve a problem that took multiple attempts
- Make database or schema changes
- Update configurations that affect system behavior

Skip it for: trivial typo fixes, simple doc updates, quick questions without implementation.

**Rule of thumb:** if it took more than 15 minutes, or future-you would want to know why, document it.

## Naming convention

Files go in `logs/chat-summaries/` with this format:

```
YYYYMMDD-brief-description.md
```

Examples:
- `20260223-add-user-auth.md`
- `20260222-fix-payment-race-condition.md`

Rules: lowercase, kebab-case, start with date, 3–7 words describing what was done.

## Template

Copy the template from `logs/CHAT_SUMMARY_TEMPLATE.md` into a new file.

Key sections to always fill in: Overview, Problem/Objective, Solution/Implementation, Files Changed.

## Adding to the development log

After creating a summary, add an entry at the top of `logs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD

### [Category] Brief description
→ [chat-summaries/YYYYMMDD-description.md](chat-summaries/YYYYMMDD-description.md)
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
```

## Categories

Pick the most relevant: Feature, Bug Fix, Refactor, Performance, Security, Database, Configuration, Integration, UI/UX, Testing, Documentation, Investigation.

## Best practices

- **Be concise but complete** — "Added email resend with rate limiting (max 3/hour)" not "Fixed email stuff"
- **Explain the why, not just the what** — "Used debouncing (300ms) on search input to reduce API calls" not "Added debouncing to search"
- **Capture failed attempts** — they're as valuable as the solution
- **Link related work** — connect to related past summaries
