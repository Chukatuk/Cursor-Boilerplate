# Rule Management

When creating or editing rules in `.cursor/rules/`, follow this governance spec exactly.

## File naming

- All rule files go in `.cursor/rules/`
- Use lowercase kebab-case with `.mdc` extension: `my-rule-name.mdc`
- Prefix with a number to control load order: `000-` for meta/governance, `001-099` for agent behavior, `100-199` for workflow, `200-299` for context/memory, `300+` for project-specific tech rules
- One concern per file. If a rule grows beyond 500 lines, split it.

## Required frontmatter

Every rule must start with a YAML block:

```yaml
---
description: <one sentence — highly specific, used by semantic search to surface this rule>
globs: <optional glob pattern, e.g. **/*.ts — omit if not file-scoped>
alwaysApply: <true for global rules, false for file-scoped rules>
---
```

- `description` must be specific enough that the IDE's semantic search can match it to a relevant user request. Bad: "TypeScript rules". Good: "Enforces async/await error handling patterns for TypeScript API routes".
- Use `alwaysApply: true` sparingly — only for rules that genuinely apply to every task.
- Use `globs` for rules that only matter in specific file contexts.

## Content guidelines

- See `000-creating-rules.mdc` for full authoring best practices.
- Point to canonical code files instead of pasting large blocks.
- No generic framework docs — only project-specific patterns and constraints.
- Include both DO and DON'T examples when the distinction is non-obvious.

## When the AI creates a new rule

1. Determine the correct numeric prefix based on concern type.
2. Draft the frontmatter with a precise `description`.
3. Keep the body under 500 lines and focused on one concern.
4. Present the draft to the human for approval — never write a rule file autonomously without showing it first.
