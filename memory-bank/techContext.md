## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Language | | | |
| Runtime | | | |
| Framework | | | |
| Database | | | |
| Auth | | | |
| Hosting | | | |

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- [TOOL + VERSION]

### Key commands
```
[start command]        # [what it does]
[test command]         # [what it does]
[build command]        # [what it does]
```

## Technical Constraints

<!-- Hard constraints the AI must never violate -->
- [CONSTRAINT, e.g., "Must run on Node 18 — no Node 20+ APIs"]
- [CONSTRAINT, e.g., "All secrets via environment variables, never hardcoded"]

## Environment Variables

```
[VAR_NAME]       # [what it's for]
```
