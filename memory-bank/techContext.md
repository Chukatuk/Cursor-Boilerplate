## Technology Stack

<!-- Fill in each layer relevant to your project. Add or remove rows as needed. -->

| Layer | Technology | Version | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| Language | | | |
| Runtime | | | |
| Framework | | | |
| Database | | | |
| Auth | | | |
| Hosting | | | |

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
<!-- List tools and versions needed to run this project locally. -->
- Tool + minimum version

### Key commands
<!-- The commands a developer runs daily. Keep this short and accurate. -->
```
start command        # what it does
test command         # what it does
build command        # what it does
```

## Technical Constraints

<!-- Hard rules the AI must never violate. Examples:
     - "Must support Node 18 LTS — no Node 20+ APIs"
     - "All secrets via environment variables, never hardcoded"
     - "No external network calls in unit tests" -->
- Constraint 1
- Constraint 2

## Environment Variables

<!-- List every env var the project needs. The AI uses this to know what's available. -->
```
VAR_NAME        # what it's for
```
