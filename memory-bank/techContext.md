## Technology Stack

<!-- List every major technology in use. Be specific about versions if they matter. -->

| Layer | Technology | Version | Notes |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------|
| [e.g., Language] | [e.g., TypeScript] | [e.g., 5.x] | [any notes] |
| [e.g., Runtime] | | | |
| [e.g., Framework] | | | |
| [e.g., Database] | | | |
| [e.g., Auth] | | | |
| [e.g., Hosting] | | | |

## Local Development Setup

<!-- How does a developer get this running locally? -->

### Prerequisites
- [TOOL + VERSION REQUIRED]

### Steps
1. [STEP 1]
2. [STEP 2]

### Key commands
```
[start command]        # [what it does]
[test command]         # [what it does]
[build command]        # [what it does]
```

## External APIs and Integrations

<!-- List every external service this project calls -->

| Service | Purpose | Auth Method | Notes |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| [SERVICE NAME] | [WHAT IT DOES] | [API key / OAuth / etc.] | [any notes] |

## Testing Approach

<!-- How is this project tested? -->
- **Unit tests**: [framework, e.g., Jest / pytest / Go test]
- **Integration tests**: [framework or N/A]
- **E2E tests**: [framework or N/A]
- **How to run tests**: `[command]`

## Technical Constraints

<!-- Hard constraints the AI must never violate -->
- [CONSTRAINT 1, e.g., "Must run on Node 18 — no Node 20+ APIs"]
- [CONSTRAINT 2, e.g., "No external network calls in unit tests"]
- [CONSTRAINT 3, e.g., "All secrets via environment variables, never hardcoded"]

## Environment Variables

<!-- List required env vars (not their values) -->
```
[VAR_NAME]       # [what it's for]
[VAR_NAME]       # [what it's for]
```
